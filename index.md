## Background

---------------------------------------------------------------------

*This section mostly details my historical relationship with computers*

- Birthplace: Los Angeles, CA
> I lived in Los Angeles till I was 35 and was raised as a poor inner city kid.

*The beginning*

A few friends that I had who at the time, came from money in my eyes, had computers and they used to let me use from time to time. 
I loved computer right from the jump and wished I had my own.
I used to watch one of my friends dad work on computers and do some programming and wished I knew how to do what he was doing.
We used Apple II machines in school sometimes and I wondered why we couldn't always just be using them for school to learn everything.

*A Machine of our own*

When I was 15 years old in 1998 my brother got a job and bought a Dell which he paid monthly for.
I was waiting on the doorstep every day for it and was there the moment it was delivered.
I brought the box inside the apartment and unboxed then set the machine up on a desk my brother had set up a few days prior.
I called my brother at work and asked him if I could turn the machine on. He said "NO! Wait till I get home you shouldn't have unboxed it leave it alone!"
I waited till he got home and watched him go through the setup steps of personalizing the windows 98 environment.
I hovered over his back the entire time and after an hour or so on the machine he stopped moving the mouse around and kind of just looked at the screen.
Then he said angrily "Fine! Use it!" and got up and walked away.
I sat down immediately and didn't get up for at least 8 - 12 hours.
I slept a small amount of hours the first couple weeks because I just wanted to be on the machine all day.


*Introuduction to Linux*

I learned what Unix was from watching the movie hackers.
I was first introduced to Linux from reading Unix books and manuals in the public library.
Within the first month of having our own machine I attempted a dual boot with windows and Linux and quickly learned what a master boot record was and how it was related to a boot loader.
I was trying to run Linux Slackware along side of Windows using the LILO bootloader.
So I partitioned the 60gb hard and allocated 10gb's for Linux hoping my brother really wouldn't care or notice.
It was a disaster. I ended up getting all 9's across the entirety of the screen.
I didn't know what to do and when my brother came home he saw what I did and looked at me and just said "FIX IT!" then went to his room.

I pulled the hard drive out of the machine and hopped on the bus to the local internet cafe so I could fish around the internet to see if I could find some answers.
I talked the internet cafe owner into allowing me to disasemble one of his test machines so I could attach my hard drive on as a slave in hopes of sorting the issue out.
Long story short I fixed the problem later that day shortly before the shop closed at night.
There began my Linux journey.

Now in retrospec if I had to create a Linux slogan based on my Linux journey it might be something like:

**Linux**

*An operating system for people looking for long journeys into manuals, cryptic documentation and forums filled with arrogant people and RTFM responses.*



> 25 years later here I am with 5 different machines all running Linux.

## Work Style

-----------------------

*I am obsessed with computers and programming. When most people pack it in for the day I continue to work on anything I can. I really like the feeling of being mentally exhausted and crave it. It's currently 3am as I type this.*

The structure of the way that I begin a project
First really understand the actual idea or problem that is trying to be solved then:

1. Type out all of the necessary things im going to need to make the thing work.
2. Break up whatever it is im working on into section. 
3. Then ill type out as many details and caveats for each section as I can think of.
3. Then ill use simple words to start puttting the logic together that im going to need to make things work.
4. After that I start to consider mechanically what the logic is going to look like in terms of code 
> ie. 
> - Ill need to import these modules to handle a, b and c
> - Many people are going to use this code ok ill need a class so people could instantiate a bunch of these objects.
> - In the initializer ill have x, y, z 
> - Should I use a loop or recursion in this one method. Ok ill test both and time them maybe use a generator in this other part.
> - We are going to be storing this large thing in memory ok maybe ill chop it up make the program faster.
> - Alright ill catch this one exception over here.
> - Im gonna need some conditions to check this other thing at the gate
> - Ok where in this thing could someone do something stupid let me make it so they can't do something stupid.
> - etc..
5. Think about the best way to implement something.
6. Then finally ill start to code stuff out.
7. Ill check to make sure I dont have a bunch of the same logic all over the place if I see code like that in a Function or Method many times ill just add another paramater and refactor.
8. With step 7 in mind ill see what parts of the code I could reuse somewhere else and if it's a good or bad idea for whatever reason.
9. Sometimes I might start considering if the thing is scallable or not.
10. Ultimately I will test the code and refactor as need be.


*I work hard at not falling into the trap of being  over confident and as a result becoming married to an idea. The skill of recognizing that someone elses idea is better than yours is more valuable than over confidence in your own idea. It's a massive skill to be able to see that an idea is superior to yours in a way that removes your ego from the equation to simply get something done quicker or better.*
