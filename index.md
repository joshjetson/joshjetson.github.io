## Work Style

-----------------------

*I am obsessed with computers and programming. When most people pack it in for the day I continue to work on anything I can. I really like the feeling of being mentally exhausted and crave it. It's currently 3am as I type this.*

The structure of the way that I begin a project
First really understand the actual idea or problem that is trying to be solved then:

1. Type out all of the necessary things im going to need to make the thing work.
2. Break up whatever it is im working on into section. 
3. Then ill type out as many details and caveats for each section as I can think of.
3. Then ill use simple words to start puttting the logic together that im going to need to make things work.
4. After that I start to consider mechanically what the logic is going to look like in terms of code 
> ie. 
> - Ill need to import these modules to handle a, b and c
> - Many people are going to use this code ok ill need a class so people could instantiate a bunch of these objects.
> - In the initializer ill have x, y, z 
> - Should I use a loop or recursion in this one method. Ok ill test both and time them maybe use a generator in this other part.
> - We are going to be storing this large thing in memory ok maybe ill chop it up make the program faster.
> - Alright ill catch this one exception over here.
> - Im gonna need some conditions to check this other thing at the gate
> - Ok where in this thing could someone do something stupid let me make it so they can't do something stupid.
> - etc..
5. Think about the best way to implement something.
6. Then finally ill start to code stuff out.
7. Ill check to make sure I dont have a bunch of the same logic all over the place if I see code like that in a Function or Method many times ill just add another paramater and refactor.
8. With step 7 in mind ill see what parts of the code I could reuse somewhere else and if it's a good or bad idea for whatever reason.
9. Sometimes I might start considering if the thing is scallable or not.
10. Ultimately I will test the code and refactor as need be.


*I work hard at not falling into the trap of being  over confident and as a result becoming married to an idea. The skill of recognizing that someone elses idea is better than yours is more valuable than over confidence in your own idea. It's a massive skill to be able to see that an idea is superior to yours in a way that removes your ego from the equation to simply get something done quicker or better.*
