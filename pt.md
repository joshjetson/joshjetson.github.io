# Permit Technician Understanding

------------------------------------------------------



## Based on the city of Schertz job description

------------------------------------------

- Provide outstanding service to internal staff and customers.
> *Self explanatory and personality based*

- Timely processing incoming emails, calls and messages regarding permit and inspection procedures; building code regulations; city ordinances; and state and federal law applicable to construction practices.
> *What this means is, on top of anything else you will be doing, you will also be handling internet based interactions which include organizing, prioritizing and based on priority responding.*
> Some questions:
> - Is this workload distributed or shared among other employees or permit techs or will it be a sole responsibility included in the list of duties of the newly appointed permit tech ?


- Prepare and submit activity reports resulting from building permit reports.
> - What is the frequency of how often these reports are going to need to be prepared and submitted ?

- Prepare and submit statistical data to include processing of refunds and accounts receivable reports.
> - What is the frequency of how often these reports are going to need to be prepared and submitted ?


- Handle cash; and balance daily cash report to prepare the deposits for funds received.
> Is there a shared system already in place to balance the daily cash reports or is this implemented individually per permit technician or as needed ? 

- Process and route of complaints to appropriate department.
> What does a scenario that falls under this job duty look like ? What is a simple example of this scenario ?

- Schedule Certificate of occupancy inspections.
(*Legal document that proves a structure, such as a house or office building, is safe to inhabit.*)
> **Contains:**
> - Property address and owner
> - Description of specific legal use and type of property: ie. Property class from the zoning perspective (Residential, Commercial, Industrial, retail or mixed use of purpose) ensures the property is being used as intended.
> - Verification that the property is up to building code compliance.
> - Confirmation that the property is suitable to be occupied. Without a CO the property cannot be legally occupied.
>
>
> **A C.O is needed:**
> - If a major renovation is completed
> - If an intention is to change a property from one type to another.
> - If a property is newly constructed.
> - If a property has a new owner or occupant.
>
> **Questions:**
> - Is there a specific calendar designated for occupancy inspections ?
> - Who performs the occupancy inspections ? City Inspector ? Property Inspector ? 
> - What is a guesstimate of the frequency that certificate of occupancy inspections are requested ? Multiple daily ? A ballpark amount weekly ? 


- Develop and prepare customer handouts and detail sheets of departmental procedures; and various types of permit applications for public access and use.
> - Does develop in this respect mean create new handouts including graphic design or possibly using some generic template or simply maybe adding to existing documents.


> Develop forms necessary for processing of building permit applications.
> - Is this a similar process when compared to developing handouts ?

- Notify Business Office of utility meter sets for new  construction project.
> - Is this in reference to some internal business office or an external business office that is used ? I'm guessing what happens is every time a new construction project is registered utility meter sets need to be ordered based on the projects needs.

- Maintain project files on all building applications and permits.
> - Are these files currently physically managed or digitally managed ? 
> - How are these files currently organized and accessed ?
> - What are the permit technicians limitations in terms of modifying the current system by which applications and permits are stored, accessed and organized ? 
> - Ask this question also as a kind of general question pertaining to different types of files and forms it's possible there are unique privileges and limitations for specific cases.

- Maintain contractor registration on an annual basis. (Straight forward after above questions are answered.)

- Conduct basic plan and application reviews and issue various types of building and sub-trade permits.
> - I'm assuming this is a daily duty based on the idea that applications are going to have different submission dates and therefore different reviewal time frames based on urgency, application type or other factors. 

- Review and process annual Mobile Home Park and Home Occupation Licenses.
> See if there is some kind of notification software in place that notifies x amount of days before expiry.

- Intake of permit applications and building plans for new construction; distribution of plans as necessary to all associated departments for plan review.
> Get an idea of what the process of organizing these applications looks like. Are there inboxes and outboxes for specific departments based on paperwork or is this a digitally managed process ? Also find out if this system could be improved or modified under the duties of a permit technician.

- Provide technical support to other departments in the issuance and collection of fire, engineering and floodplain permits.
> What is the estimated frequency of how often this type of support is required weekly ?

- Document building permits and associated plans and drawings in Laserfiche system.
> Not an interview question but find out what this looks like inside of the laser fiche system and how to do it.

- Schedule inspections for customer walk-ins; contractors and inspectors.
> - Is there a scheduling software for this ?  How are customers, contractors and inspectors notified of inspection dates and times ?
> - This must mean that there are various types of inspections. Find out how many types.





Ultimately try to get a distribution of the workload for a permit technician in terms of different percentages per job duties. Just a ballpark.
