---------------------------------
The idea behind this page is that through out the years I have worked on a lot of coding related material that may still have value either to showcase or for someone else to get gain some understanding from it.

## Puzzles

-----------------------------------

A bunch of coding puzzles that I have solved.

It's my opinion that puzzles are a crucial part of being able to think like a programmer.
As a programmer you need to be able to think of a solution to a problem on the fly that someone might throw at you for whatever reason.
In school you learn to think about things in order to pass a test or turn in an assigment and many times, for a number of different factors, you don't have the space to think about things critically.
In the real world your looking at problems that are , many times, a lot less defined.
Contrary to what some may think, being an effective programmer requires a great deal of creativity.
In order to be creative in any craft you have to know how to use the tools or tool set you are given.
Finding solutions to programming problems helps you build a kind of swiss army knife that you can pull at at will.
They help you think on your toes and give you a greater understanding of the tools you have at your disposal.



## Data Structures

---------------------------------

Once you start understanding what data structures are you slowly start to unravel the composition of a programming language.
The ideas of:

- How to store something
- How to get something thats stored
- How to delete something thats stored
- How to not only delete something but get it back to be used right before it gets deleted.
- How to treat or handle different data types
- How to access something you stored quickly
- How to iterate over things and the different options conceptually regarding iteration and how it could be performed.
- How to change or set something that is stored
- How to insert a new item in between other items
- How to create associations between things that are stored so that one has an effect over the other.
- How to give something properties and different attributes.
