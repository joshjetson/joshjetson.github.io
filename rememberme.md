## What is RememberMe ?

RememberMe is a paid participatory service in where friends and family members of a chosen subject assist in a process and effort to create an AI model which can think and answer prompts in a very similar fashion to the chosen subject in their own voice or in a voice that sounds nearly identical to the subjects.  

**Options**

- 3D interactive model built in the likness of the subject 

## Why ?

- We all have people we love
- We all have people we never want to forget
- We all have people we wish we could still interact with
- We all have people we wish someone else could have interacted with

## The Who ?
(*The Subject*)

The subject could be anyone willing to participate in the process who either wants to be remembered or others want to remember.

## The Process

The entire process will consist of standard training and multiple testing phases.

**Initial Decisions made by the subject and participants**

- How long would they like the service campaign to run for. (Incuding training and testing)
- The degree of service generated prompt participation. (Respective towards training and testing)
- How long each participant will participate in the training and testing phase.
- How many people are willing to participate.
- How many questions the subject is willing to answer daily.
- The daily schedule by which prompts should be generated to the subject.

### How the process works

The main point of interaction between the service, the subject and the participants will be through a mobile application.

- Participants will be able to create prompts for the subject to answer.
- The subject will answer a randomized pool of prompts in their own voice.

**Prompt Types**

- Personal based prompts: questions from the participant to the subject.
- Chronology based prompts: Historical/Event/Time-Line related questions compiled by the participants.
- Geographic based prompts: Where the subject has been, where specific events took place etc..
- Personality assesment based prompts: These prompts would be intended to invoke specific emotional responses by the subject ie. Humor, Nostalgia, Sadness, Anger etc..
> The participants and or subject will have the option and understanding that omitting specific personality assesment based prompts will effectivley create a bias and an ultimately less accurate personality encapsulation. Which the participants and or subject may prefer or desire. 
- Idiomatic based prompts: The intention of this style of prompt is to capture specific verbage, colloquialisms and ways of communicating which are unique to the subject.
- Logic based prompts: Prompts which are indended to capture a subjects rational mind, wisdom and general problem solving abilities.
- Ideological based prompts
- Description based prompts: Pictures of participants should be presented to the subject and questions like. What did you think of this persons hair or is this person good looking or what do you think of this persons clothes.



**Training Phase**

The training phase will run for a set amount of days decided by the entire party.

Participants will select prompt types and create their own unique questions based on the prompt category.

**Testing Phases**

The testing phase will be similar to the training phase accept instead of participants interacting with the subject they will now be interacting with the model under the supervision of the subject who would correct or tailor the models responses. 


## Data Security

A general contractual template will be provided to the participants and subject.
The contract will have the following traits:

- State clearly that the data captured will be owned and unlicensable or unsellable by any parties other than the participants and subject.
- An explanation of how the data is secured and simply sitting in a data lake unrelated to itself without a specific type of encrypted key which participants create and have exclusive access to.
- The contract itself will mutable only by the participants and subject either collectively or how ever they decide.
- Under the scope of the contractual process the service team is only meant to assist in guiding the participants and subject in creating a contract that is to their benifit and security.

**Personal thoughts about data and rights to data**

Its is very important to me that people and or families own their sensitive personal data.
It is important to me that this data can not be stolen or accessed by anyone other then those by whom the data belongs to.
I have an understanding of how this can be achieved and I want to make this a very large immutable focal point for this project as I consider it paramount. 


## Concerns

-------------------------------------

> This project and concept is very controversial, largely due to the lack of understanding of how AI models work.I want to highlight some concerns and give my thoughts on them in an effort to direct peoples minds away from misconceptions regarding AI and shed some light on some ideas they may have never considered.
Preface

> Consider a photograph now a days. Not a picture on your phone but just a simple printed photograph. If you took a photograph of a person with you as you traveled back in time 700 years ago and then showed a random adult the photograph they might think all kind’s of wild thing’s such as:

- What an incredible painting !
- Oh my that poor soul is trapped in this piece of paper etc..

> Both of these thoughts are very far from the truth of the matter as to what the photograph actually is. If you conducted the same experiment but this time instead of a photograph you used actual live video played from a modern device the results of what someone would think would be even more wild.

**What does of photograph and a video of someone have in common ?**

- They are both visual encapsulations of a moment in time. One, that is dynamic with motion and perhaps audio , the other static containing purely visual aspects.*Something to consider*


> An AI model which has been modeled after a real live person has more in common with a digital video than it does with an actual living breathing person. It is pure entertainment and in fact a new form of it and nothing else. People 700 years ago could easily be fooled by a picture into thinking the person that was in the photo is actually alive and trapped inside of it. This is a similar mindset that some people fall into when considering AI.

> AI is becoming really good at tricking people into making them believe it is just like them and alive somewhere with feelings and thoughts of it’s own. In reality it is just a set of instructions that can get good at finding and presenting similar items. For anyone who has any kind of idea about anything, your perception on something should be based on what you know about it and not what you don’t. This presents a problem because often what happens now a days is that people hear things through social media and think they know something. We are bombarded with headlines which are engineered in a very calculated manner to get you to click on something and often times what you click on will form your mind around what something is. I can not give you an in depth lesson on what AI is and how it works exactly but what I can say is this.

**AI is:**

- A bunch of math or computer instructions built to average or group things in order to find similarities between data points.
- Entertainment with utility like your smart phone

**RememberMeAI is:**

- An abstraction.
- Entertainment
- Not Real
- Fun
- Sad
- Nostalgic
- Like taking a picture of someone when they are 25 and then another when the person is 60 . The photos may look dramatically different. This is a similar idea to an AI model which has been modeled around a person. The model is a representation or an encapsulation of the person at that moment in time but it is not the actual person and honestly will pale in comparison.

**RememberMeAI is not:**

- The actual person it was modeled after.
- Gonna call you at 1 am because it has a problem and needs your advice.
- Ever going to be hungry and need food.
- Ever truly going to replace anyone.
