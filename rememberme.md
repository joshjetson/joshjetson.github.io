# RememberMe

## What is RememberMe ?

RememberMe is a paid participatory service in where friends and family members of a chosen subject assist in a process and effort to create an AI model which can think and answer prompts in a very similar fashion to the chosen subject in their own voice or in a voice that sounds nearly identical to the subjects.  

**Options**

- 3D interactive model built in the likness of the subject 

## Why ?

- We all have people we love
- We all have people we never want to forget
- We all have people we wish we could still interact with
- We all have people we wish someone else could have interacted with

## The Who ?
(*The Subject*)

The subject could be anyone willing to participate in the process who either wants to be remembered or others want to remember.

## The Process

The entire process will consist of standard training and multiple testing phases.

**Initial Decisions made by the subject and participants**

- How long would they like the service campaign to run for. (Incuding training and testing)
- The degree of service generated prompt participation. (Respective towards training and testing)
- How long each participant will participate in the training and testing phase.
- How many people are willing to participate.
- How many questions the subject is willing to answer daily.
- The daily schedule by which prompts should be generated to the subject.

### How the process works

The main point of interaction between the service, the subject and the participants will be through a mobile application.

- Participants will be able to create prompts for the subject to answer.
- The subject will answer a randomized pool of prompts in their own voice.

**Prompt Types**

- Personal based prompts: questions from the participant to the subject.
- Chronology based prompts: Historical/Event/Time-Line related questions compiled by the participants.
- Geographic based prompts: Where the subject has been, where specific events took place etc..
- Personality assesment based prompts: These prompts would be intended to invoke specific emotional responses by the subject ie. Humor, Nostalgia, Sadness, Anger etc..
> The participants and or subject will have the option and understanding that omitting specific personality assesment based prompts will effectivley create a bias and an ultimately less accurate personality encapsulation. Which the participants and or subject may prefer or desire. 
- Idiomatic based prompts: The intention of this style of prompt is to capture specific verbage, colloquialisms and ways of communicating which are unique to the subject.
- Logic based prompts: Prompts which are indended to capture a subjects rational mind, wisdom and general problem solving abilities.
- Ideological based prompts
- Description based prompts: Pictures of participants should be presented to the subject and questions like. What did you think of this persons hair or is this person good looking or what do you think of this persons clothes.



**Training Phase**

The training phase will run for a set amount of days decided by the entire party.

Participants will select prompt types and create their own unique questions based on the prompt category.

**Testing Phases**

The testing phase will be similar to the training phase accept instead of participants interacting with the subject they will now be interacting with the model under the supervision of the subject who would correct or tailor the models responses. 


## Data Security

A general contractual template will be provided to the participants and subject.
The contract will have the following traits:

- State clearly that the data captured will be owned and unlicensable or unsellable by any parties other than the participants and subject.
- An explanation of how the data is secured and simply sitting in a data lake unrelated to itself without a specific type of encrypted key which participants create and have exclusive access to.
- The contract itself will mutable only by the participants and subject either collectively or how ever they decide.
- Under the scope of the contractual process the service team is only meant to assist in guiding the participants and subject in creating a contract that is to their benifit and security.

**Personal thoughts about data and rights to data**

Its is very important to me that people and or families own their sensitive personal data.
It is important to me that this data can not be stolen or accessed by anyone other then those by whom the data belongs to.
I have an understanding of how this can be achieved and I want to make this a very large immutable focal point for this project as I consider it paramount.
