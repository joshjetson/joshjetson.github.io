This project is the foundations of a much more comprehensive library in the future. This project is in the beta stages of development.

> </details>
>
> <details><summary><b><i> What excites you about this position or our company? Please write a few sentences at least.</b></i></summary>
>
>> - The primary aspect that excites me about this role is simply working in a Linux environment and growing my expertise in it. I am also interested in learning more about seed boxes and seeing what things look like from a behind-the-scenes perspective. In general, the company’s mission statement (e.g. “online anonymity”) resonates with my philosophical leanings, so I’d feel confident and comfortable working toward this goal in society. 
> </details>
>
> <details><summary><b><i> Where do you see yourself in your professional career 2-3 years from today?</b></i></summary>
>
>> - Someday I would like to create a business from a piece of software I have developed. My goal is to identify a high-need area or niche in the market (and I already have ideas for this) and then proceed to develop software that fills this niche either by myself or with a small team of developers. However, my current priority is seeking traditional employment and growing professionally in that specific sector.

>
> <details><summary><b><i> Can you share your experience with customer/technical support and facing customers directly? This will be an essential part of your role, and we would love to hear why you would excel with helping customers?</b></i></summary>
>
>> - During my four-year role as a general manager in the hospitality industry in downtown Los Angeles, I directly faced customers on a daily basis from all walks of life, ranging from foreign diplomats to those facing drug addiction. Every interaction with guests or prospective guests required professionalism, wisdom and discernment in problem-solving, as well as a nuanced approach to each situation. I have faced hundreds of difficult situations with customers such as room flooding, guest disputes, break-ins, prostitution, and much more, all of which I managed with competent, friendly, and humble customer service. 
>>
>> - As for techical support, I worked at "Hot Point Wireless" helping clients (mainly hotels) address issues with their networks for five years. Clients would call reporting that their networks would go down (or other connectivity issues) and it was my job to diagnose and address issues (first attempt to do this remotely), or otherwise visit in person to install new access points, configure them on the network, and address any other complaints (and follow up) in a kind and competent manner. 
> </details>
>
> <details><summary><b><i> What are your best strengths \ super-powers if you had to choose them?</b></i></summary>
>
>> - My "superpower" is probably related to audio processing; I am an excellent listener. I stay quiet and allow customers to feel heard when expressing their concerns or complaints. Especially when given the chance to take notes, I can also go over the notes again and get a firm understanding of the issue or content being presented to me. 
> </details>
>
> <details><summary><b><i> Please write as much as you like and telling about yourself. Your goal is to sell us on why you are the best candidate for this job.</b></i></summary>
>
>> - I have a passion for identifying, diagnosing, and solving problems--so much so that I often become engulfed in a task until a creative and succinct solution is found. The best part is seeing a pleased customer responding well to these solutions. I feel I am the best candidate for this job because I can apply all the methods I know (including how to learn something new) in order to secure a solution for the most complicated challenges. In addition, I'm very comfortable with working within a team, presenting information/reports, and getting people on board with ideas that propel everyone forward.

>
> <details><summary><b><i> What most appeals to you about this job?</b></i></summary>
>
>> - I feel strongly that a remote work environment is conducive to a higher level of productivity as well as a healthier work-life balance. Other than working in Linux, this is the aspect that appeals to me most about this role. 
> </details>
>
> <details><summary><b><i> Please describe a time where you changed something at work that led to increased efficiency, general happiness or increase in productivity?</b></i></summary>
>
>> - I created brand new infrastructure in the daily operations of the small hotel where I worked as General Manager, which led to better systems and productivity among staff and leadership. 
>>
>> - For example, I replaced the network switch, installed access points, and ran new cables between the two. This greatly increased guest access to the wireless network, which resulted in higher customer satisfaction and a consistent base of repeat customers. 
>>
>> - Another example was that I implemented an incentive program for employees to earn monetary bonuses to supplement their current wages and other privileges such as more vacation days. As a result of this, our employee turnover decreased dramatically and we were able to retain the best personnel both at the front desk and in housekeeping. 
>>
>> - I also streamlined and more effectively budgeted our maintenance requirements, which ultimately put back into service 10 rooms that had long been inoperable/out of service. This helped maximize hotel revenue. In addition, without being asked, I sought out new sources of revenue such as listing our hotel on extranets such as Airbnb, Agoda, and Expedia.

At the root of the links you will find a website that my wife uses for her students. It is a very bad site.

>> - When I worked in technical support for 5 years at "Hot Point Wireless", my job was to help clients (mainly hotels) address issues with their networks. Clients would call reporting that their networks would go down (or other connectivity issues) and it was my job to diagnose and address issues (first attempting to do this remotely, or otherwise visiting in person to install new access points, configure them on the network, and address any other complaints (and follow up) in a kind and competent manner).
>>
>> - I was so effective in this role that I was eventually offered a General Manager position at one of the hotel branches which needed the most transformation. I accepted the new role and immediately created brand new infrastructure in the daily operations, which led to better systems and productivity among staff and leadership. To mention a relevant example, I resolved hotel-wide network connectivity issues by replacing the network switch, installing access points, and running new cables between the two. This greatly increased guest access to the wireless network, which resulted in higher customer satisfaction and a consistent base of repeat customers.
>>
>> - In 2008 I worked as a website admin and also acted as the companies sole help desk personel. The vast majority of our cleints were elderly individuals who had great anxiety and difficulty navigating the web. I was able to implement an easy to access FAQ which greatly decreased the amount of inbound phone calls we recieved. In addition the FAQ streamlined telephone conversations assisting those who were still experiencing trouble finding our products and completing orders.
